                            <p>During my time at Plexus, I contributed to winning a contract to develop a negative pressure wound therapy system resulting in me becoming the lead software engineer on the project during phase one of development.
                                This required me to control a piezoelectric pump to create a constant pressure of 80 mmHg under a leaking bandage using an STM microcontroller. As well as developing various test programs to evaluate hardware selection. I was also
                                responsible for communicating weekly progress regarding software development directly to the client.
                                This experience was pivotal in my understanding of how to develop business relationships with an external client as well as my confidence in using embedded C.

                            <p>Over the course of three months, I investigated whether a commercial phase lock loop could be used in future radar projects. In doing so I produced a user guide outlining how the PLL could be used within a radar system.
                                As well as compiling an error log from extensive use of the product which was relayed back to the supplier. This experience exposed me to various technical equipment such as an FSWP Phase Noise Analyzer, VCO Tester and RF near field probe.
                                As well as increasing my confidence working within a commercial controlled laboratory environment.

                            <p>For my first technical internship, I was asked to investigate and improve the testing methods of a power and control card used on the Osprey radar system, currently in use on the Norwegian coast guard search and rescue helicopter.
                                This resulted in me developing automation programs in Python, which rapidly reduced testing times. I was also able to enhance various tests by reducing their scope on particular boards. 
                                Enhancing various technical skills such as working with FPGAs and the JTAG interface, as well as how to present results in a professional manner, through documentation and presentations to management.

                                From undertaking component level repairs on TVs, I was taught how to identify issues on circuit boards and solder neatly. Combined with how to fix software and firmware issues on computer
                                systems. I was also part of a team responsible for installing IT infrastructure such as active network equipment, servers, structured cabling and end user device implementation.
                                Where I learnt how to interact with clients and how to adapt solutions to suit their needs.

                <p>Working with Craft Prospect was one of my favourite projects to date. Managing a team of student software engineers to develop an arcade game that could be run on a Raspberry Pi.

My tasks included developing the interface between the neural network and the game, training the network as well as management
                    and communications with the client. This solution is now in active use by Craft Prospect to demonstrate their technologies in an innovative way.

                        Building on experiences using C within embedded systems, as well as classes such as Systems Programming, Computer Architecture and Network Systems. I am confident in developing data structures and small programs.
                        I particularly enjoy using C and realise its various benefits so it is something I am activley trying to improve.

                        I have used HTML and CSS for a number of years, mainly utlising them to adapt large Bootstrap templates or Dash web applications, as well as to develop small websites from scratch. 
                        From a recent interest in front end development I am currently trying to develop my undertanding of these two languages.
