                            <p>During my time at Plexus, I contributed to winning a contract to develop a negative wound therapy system resulting in me becoming the lead software engineer during phase one of development.
                                This required me to control a piezoelectric pump to create a constant pressure of 80 mmHg under a leaking bandage using an STM microcontroller. As well as developing various test programs to evaluate hardware selection. I was also
                                responsible for communicating weekly progress regarding software development directly to the client.
                                This experience was pivotal in my understanding of how to develop business relationships with an external client as well as my confidence in using embedded C.

                            <p>Over the course of three months, I investigated whether a commercial phase lock loop could be used in future radar projects. In doing so I produced a user guide outlining how the PLL could be used within a radar system.
                                As well as compiling an error log from extensive use of the product which was relayed back the supplier. This experience exposed me to various technical equipment such as an FSWP Phase Noise Analyzer, VCO Tester and RF near field probe.
                                Showing me how to conduct within a lab as well as increasing my confidence within a professional laboratory set up.

                            <p>For my first technical internship, I was asked to investigate and improve the testing methods of a power and control card used on the Osprey radar system, currently in use on the Norwegian coast guard search and rescue helicopter.
                                This resulted in me developing automation programs in Python, which rapidly reduced testing times. I was also able to enhance various tests by reducing their scope on particular boards. 
                                Enhancing various technical skills such as working with FPGAs and the JTAG interface, as well as how to present results in a professional environment, through documentation and presentations to management.

                                From undertaking component level repairs on TVs, I was taught how identify issues on circuit boards and solder neatly. Combined with how to fix software and firmware issues on computer
                                systems. I was also a part of team responsible for installing IT infastructure such as active network equipment, servers, structured cabiling and end user device implementation.
                                Where I learnt how to interact with a client and how to adapt solutions to suit their needs.

                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
